          <p>I don't remember my real mom. My first memories were in boxes. I was in a glass box for many days during that time. I remember I did not want to be there. During those times, I remember feeling lonely. There were barely any times when we were allowed to go outside. There were a lot of us. There were a lot of others too, but only when there was light. Sometimes the others would walk by and touch me or pick me up, it was really nice actually, but they would always put me back down and leave. It was always sad to see them leave, and for the lights in me would go off too. I felt like when the lights go off, the lights in me go off too. It wasn't so bad because that time didn't last for very long. I got lonely a lot. I'm lonely sometimes now too but it's not the same as before. At least now, I have my mom. I think sometimes she is lonlier than I am. I know because when that happens, she comes near me and she starts talking to me. I don't know what she's saying but I know she's telling me she's hurting. I always listen anyway. She saved me from the box. I remember when she picked me up for the first time, when she didn't put me back down, the light turned on so brightly in me.</p>
          <p>Those were such happy days when I roamed about the house and went outside with her. Each day I would wait so long for her to come home and when she did it was like she was waiting just as long to see me too. She would pick me up and I would climb up on her to lick her eyes and mouth. I remember the way she smelled and everytime she was near I would sniff her hair because I like the way mom smells. She would smother me, I would chase her, we would go outside and walk and run. The sunshine was so bright outside and there was so many things to do. Sometimes at night, I would lay on mom as we watch others move and talk on the rectangle. I did not care that much for it, I really just wanted to be near my mom. Those were the happiest times, the newness of everything was so exciting.</p>
          <p>Even though we would spend a lot of time together at the beginning, after a while I did not see my mom as much. She didn't pick me up as much as she used to and after while, even though I would still be excited to see her when she came home, she wouldn't be as excited to see me. There were even times when she seemed to get annoyed if I was around. I missed her all the time, so I just wanted to be around her. We still went outside and walked, we still watched the rectangle at night together and sometimes she would even kiss my head and eyes. It's just that sometimes waiting for my mom to come home would be a long time. After awhile I got used to waiting so long. Sometimes mom would come home with some other people. I got really excited to see them. Sometimes they would get too close to my mom and I got jealous. I don't like it when mom does not pay attention to me when other people are around. She usually let me sleep in her bed but sometimes she would be with somebody else in her bed at night. I didn't like that. If I knew that would happen, I would try to get on the bed first before anybody else tried to so I could be in the bed with my mom. She would always make me get off though. I didn't like that.</p>

          <p>Je ne me souviens pas de ma vraie mère. Mes premiers souvenirs étaient dans quelques boîtes. Pendant ces jours-là, j'étais dans une boîte de verre. Je me souviens que je ne voulais pas être là. Nous avons été autorisés à sortir rarement. Il y avait beaucoup d'entre nous. Il y en avait beaucoup d'autres aussi, mais seulment quand le lumière s'allumer. Parfois, les autres passent et me touchent ou me prennent, c'était vraiment sympa en fait, mais ils me mettaient toujours en arrière et laissent. J'était toujours triste quand ils partent. Quand ils et pour les lumières en moi allait aussi. Ce n'était pas si mal, parce que ce temps ne dura pas très longtemps. Je me suis senti très seul. Je suis seul parfois maintenant aussi, mais ce n'est pas la même chose qu'auparavant. Au moins maintenant, j'ai ma mère. Je pense que parfois qu'elle est plus solitaire que moi. Je sais parce que, quand elle est triste, elle s'approche de moi et elle commence à me parler. Je ne comprends pas, mais je sais qu'elle me dit qu'elle fait mal. Alors, je l'écoute toujours. Elle m'a sauvé de la boîte. Je me souviens quand elle m'a pris pour la première fois. Quand elle ne me remit pas dans la boite, la lumière s'allumait si vivement en moi.</p>
